# Introduction

This is _Fate Condensed_, a version of _Fate Core System_ in as compact a form as we can manage. It is a complete roleplaying game; while other books might enhance your use of it, you don’t need any other book to play.

On that note, let’s get into what you _do_ need!

## What Do I Need to Play?

To play _Fate Condensed_ you’ll need two to six friends with one acting as Game Master (GM), some dice, some tokens, writing implements, paper, and something to write short notes on (_e.g.,_ small “sticky notes”).

_Fate Condensed_ uses **Fate Dice™** when characters take action. Fate dice are six-sided dice with two <dice>[0]</dice> sides, two <dice>[+]</dice> sides, and two <dice>[-]</dice> sides. One set of four dice will work fine, but one set per player is ideal. Other alternatives exist, such as using standard six-sided dice (1-2 = <dice>[-]</dice>, 3-4 = <dice>[0]</dice>, 5-6 = <dice>[+]</dice>), or the **Deck of Fate**, which uses cards instead of dice. We use the word “roll” throughout the text for simplicity.

### For Veterans: Changes From Fate Core

Condensing the gist of a system from nearly 300 pages down to about 50 pages of text does lead to a few changes. As of this writing it has also been eight years since _Fate Core System_ was created, so a little iteration of the design is to be expected. In particular, we highlight the following:

*   We’ve shifted over to one-point stress boxes to help reduce confusion (**page XX**).
*   “Balsera Style” initiative (also known as “elective action order” or “popcorn initiative”) is the default rather than using skills to determine turn order (**page XX**).
*   Advancement functions a little differently; we’ve eliminated significant milestones and finessed major milestones to compensate (**page XX**).
*   We’ve removed the notion of active opposition as separate from the defend action (**page XX**). This has a few minor ripple effects, particularly overcome’s tie result (**page XX**).
*   Create an Advantage has been tweaked to offer better clarity and agency around the discovery of existing unknown aspects (**page XX**).
*   Full defense is presented as optional and has been altered a bit to accommodate the expanded scope of the defend action (**page XX**). Other standard rules options are presented as well, starting on **page XX**.
